ðŸŽ® FRX GO is an innovative, blockchain-based fighting game that operates on the Scroll network. The game utilizes Scroll smart contracts and Noir contracts on Aztec to ensure secure and provably fair fights.

### Core Technologies

#### Scroll Network
The Scroll network provides the foundational blockchain infrastructure for FRX GO. It allows for the deployment of smart contracts that manage game logic, player interactions, and in-game assets.

#### Aztec and Noir
Aztec is leveraged to implement zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) using the Noir language. Noir is used to verify the validity of players' committed strategies without revealing the strategies themselves. This ensures both security and fairness in gameplay.

- **Noir Circuit**: The Noir circuit verifies that the challenger's committed strategy is valid by generating proofs that can be checked on-chain.
- **UltraVerifier Contract**: This contract is deployed on Fraxtal Testnet and is responsible for verifying the proofs generated by Noir.

#### Sindri
Sindri is utilized to interact with zk-proofs in a smooth and developer-friendly manner. It aids in generating proofs required by the game to validate player moves and strategies.

#### The Graph
The Graph is used to index and query game data. A subgraph is created to allow efficient querying of created games on the ScrollFighter contract, providing an overview of ongoing and completed games.

### Game Mechanics

- **Creating a Game**: Players can create new games by deploying a game smart contract that records game details and the strategies involved.
- **Joining a Game**: Other players can join open games by committing their strategies, which are verified using Noir proofs.
- **Gameplay**: Players' moves are committed and validated on-chain, ensuring that the game progresses fairly without any possibility of cheating.

### Next Steps

Future improvements planned for FRX GO include:
- Allowing open games where any player can join and accept challenges.
- Enhancing game display animations for a more polished and engaging user experience.
